//! The sandbox's content (M1 A4): the shared pack, read through the platform's IO thread, and
//! what the asset server loads from it, uploaded to the renderer.
//!
//! Assets are named by ID only (rule R5): the character is [`CHARACTER`], the mannequin's ID
//! from its sidecar (`content/samples/mannequin.glb.meta`). The asset server loads it with the
//! materials its slots name and their textures, dependencies first, and hands each to
//! [`GpuAssets`], which uploads it with the renderer's own calls and keeps the renderer's handles
//! by asset ID: a material's textures and a mesh's materials resolve through what is already
//! uploaded. The mannequin's materials are embedded today; a sidecar that binds a slot to a
//! material document draws with that material and its textures the same way.
//!
//! With `--swatches` it loads the shader swatches' three materials too, by the IDs in
//! [`swatches::MATERIALS`], each with the maps it names ([`Content::swatch_materials`]); the
//! spheres they draw on are procedural. With `--faces` it loads the face test head
//! ([`faces::HEAD`]), whose face slot the head's sidecar binds to a face material, which names an
//! SDF face map, a face mask and an expression map: all of it cooked content
//! ([`Content::face_head`]). With `--hard-edges` it loads the hard-edged outline sample
//! ([`outlines::HARD_EDGES`], [`Content::hard_edges`]).
//!
//! The zone's sky is the sky material [`SKY`] (`samples/sky.material.ron`), loaded with its cloud,
//! cirrus, moon, star and Milky Way maps ([`Content::sky_material`]).
//!
//! With `--environment` it loads the courtyard ([`environment::COURTYARD`]), whose slots its sidecar
//! binds to environment materials, which name a terminator band and a painted ground map
//! ([`Content::courtyard`]).
//!
//! A new renderer (device loss, a quality-tier change) gets everything again through
//! [`Content::renderer_rebuilt`]: the server sends every asset back through its upload queue,
//! reading meshes and textures from the pack again.
//!
//! Hot reload (M1 A8; `dev` builds remount the pack when a cook rewrites it,
//! [`Content::remount`]) sends a new version of a loaded asset through the same queue, for the
//! same slot at a higher generation: [`GpuAssets`] replaces what the renderer holds in place, so
//! the handles the scene draws with stay valid. A texture is uploaded anew and the materials
//! that bind it come again to be rebound; a material rewrites its slot; a mesh replaces its
//! streams under its handle.
//!
//! In `dev` builds the server reads packs through live link's source (M1 A9,
//! `sapphire_livelink::LivePacks`), which serves packs pushed from the desktop in place of the
//! platform's; a pushed pack is remounted the same way ([`Content::apply_pack`]).
